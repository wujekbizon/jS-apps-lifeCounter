Adding new feature to main app!

Things My Program Does:
1. Display a timer
2.Shows an animated border around timer

     Possible Implementation:

Event listener to watch for a click on 'start' button

                                                                 
	Emit an event stating that the timer has started     
	Start counting down the timer				<---    Watch for this event. When it occurs, draw the border
                                                                 
     
	Emit an event that the timer has 'ticked'            
	Each time the timer counts down, update the text
	If we counted down and timer reaches 0			<---    Watch for this event. When it occurs, update the border

                                                                  
        Emit an event that the timer is done      	     
        Reset internal timer to get ready for another run	<---    Watch for this event. When it occurs, reset the border
